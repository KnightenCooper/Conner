Software hosted on GitHub Pages that provides individuals working as Personal Assistants a means to speed up the process of creating service documentation.
Personal Assistants work for individuals with developmental disabilities and are required by for the Missouri Division of Developmental Disabilities to create documentation after each shift. 
Service documentation provides proof to funders of what services were performed, and helps track the progress and changes of behavior of the disabled individual.
# Overview

My name is Knighten Cooper and I am studying to be a software engineer. I am currently working as a Personal Assistant to an individual with a developmental disability. Every time I clock in and out, I have to create service documentation that details what I did, and what the disabled individual did.

This website was designed to make creating service documentation faster and easier. The user selects what activity they did, fills out the boxes, and then the complete service documentation is automatically generated. All the service documentation is stored at the bottom of the page. If a user leaves and comes back the documentation remains because it is stored in local storage. There is a bottom to copy the documentation so it can then be pasted into the official application. There is also a button to clear all documentation. My website only automates the portions of service documentation that are the same each day and users still need to write the unusual events that occur.

It also has a page that the disabled individual can use to communicate with because they don't talk. Another page tracks all the services that have been performed that month so it is easier for my supervisor to complete their monthly report. The final page tracks the individual’s weight to ensure they are healthy and eating properly.

My purpose in writing this software was to help me and the other workers who have to create service documentation. The additional features were added because my supervisor and the individual's family requested them.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and GitHub Pages to host. I also used CountAPI to store the totals for the data page and to store the disabled individual’s weight.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Future Work

* I would like to add more activities like going to the movies, and using the bathroom.
* I would love to allow users the ability to add their own custom activities.
* I would like to add a page that details how to use the documentation page and maybe allow users to preview documentation before adding it.
